# Vendored libarchive-wasm

CBZ and CBR comics are unpacked with [libarchive-wasm](https://github.com/ofk/libarchive-wasm) 1.2.0 before toazw3 builds a page-by-page EPUB and converts it with boko.

- Package: https://www.npmjs.com/package/libarchive-wasm
- Version: 1.2.0
- Wrapper license: MIT (see `LICENSE`)
- libarchive license: BSD-2-Clause (see `LICENSE-libarchive.txt`)
- Formats used here: ZIP (CBZ, including Zip64) and RAR v4 / RAR v5 (CBR)

`libarchive.wasm` is the unmodified build from that package. `libarchive.js` is the upstream Emscripten glue with one added line, `export default libarchive`, so the static site can import it as an ES module. toazw3 does not otherwise modify the extractor.

The wasm build statically links libarchive and the compression libraries it was compiled with (including zlib). Those components keep their own permissive licenses.
